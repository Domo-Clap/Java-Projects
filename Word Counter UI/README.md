In the past, I have had to write papers where I needed to reach a minimum word requirement. This was always annoying to me, but I didn't mind. Once I got into college, we had discussion posts, that sometimes had word limits.
This sucked even more than papers in high school because the web app we used for college assignments did not have a built in word counter for discussion posts. Thus, I had to resort to copy/pasting my discussion posts into microsoft word to see the word count.
After I was graduated, I decided to work on some small projects to understand more about java, which led me to this small little UI project.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project is really simple in that it only uses java swing and awt to create a small UI. The user is able to enter any length of text into the textField widget. Then, they can press a button that will calculate the number of words in the textField. This works by getting the full string in the textField widget, and then parsing the string by spaces. Then, the length method is used to determine the length of the list of words. Then a dialog box will pop up showing the amount of words that existed in the list.

There is also a reset button that clears the textField widget. (Makes it easier than backspacing a ton.)

It is possible to run this code if you wanted. You would just need an IDE that can handle Java like eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. I will possibly update this repository with a exe file for the app.
