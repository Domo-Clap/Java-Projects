In the past, I have had to write papers where I needed to reach a minimum word requirement. This was always annoying to me, but I didn't mind. Once I got into college, we had discussion posts, that sometimes had word limits.
This sucked even more than papers in high school because the web app we used for college assignments did not have a built in word counter for discussion posts. Thus, I had to resort to copy/pasting my discussion posts into microsoft word to see the word count.
After I was graduated, I decided to work on some small projects to understand more about java, which led me to this small little UI project.
