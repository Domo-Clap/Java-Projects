Most of the projects in this specific repository are meant as a way to gain practice with the Java programmng language. I love working with Java, and I wanted to learn more about UIs with it, so I started this repository where I can build small apps. Most of the apps are insanely simple, and do not involve multiple classes or files. However, any practice can help at this point in my life.
I hope to one day use Java to make more complex projects that I personally find useful. I also would really like to use some of the logic skills from these practice projects to one day release an app or two on the google play store.
