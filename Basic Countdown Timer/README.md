This is a super duper simple project that you can make in many different ways, but this is how I did it. As the name of the project implies, this is a simple countdown timer. I find countdown timers to be pretty useful, which is why this was a nice piece of code to work on. In my daily life, I use timers a decent bit. I use them when I am doing laundry, studying, working out, cooking, etc... They can be very useful. This iteration of a timer is only slightly useful. All it does at the moment is display a UI of a timer counting upwards.

At some point, I would like to update this project and possibly add in a feature that lets you view a regular clock, and a feature that counts down from a set time amount. These would act as some nice practice and would make the app more useful.

As for how the code works, it's very simple. There are three major functions. One to stop the timer, one to start it, and one that updates the UI for the timer. By using the Java swing Timer package, I am able to make an instance of the Timer object with a set time interval, which then connects to the updateTimerLabel function. This makes it so the UI is updated every set interval.

It is possible to run this code if you wanted. You would just need an IDE that can handle Java like eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA. I will possibly update this repository with a exe file for the app after adding other features.
