This is a super duper simple project that you can make in many different ways, but this is how I did it. As the name of the project implies, this is a simple countdown timer. I find countdown timers to be pretty useful, which is why this was a nice piece of code to work on. In my daily life, I use timers a decent bit. I use them when I am doing laundry, studying, working out, cooking, etc... They can be very useful. This iteration of a timer is only slightly useful. All it does at the moment is display a UI of a timer counting upwards.

At some point, I would like to update this project and possibly add in a feature that lets you view a regular clock, and a feature that counts down from a set time amount. These would act as some nice practice and would make the app more useful.
